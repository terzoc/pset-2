/**
 * Problem Set 2.
 *
 * It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on prompting
 * the user for information, manipulating that information, and printing it in
 * specific formats.
 *
 * The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write
 * lines of code to produce answers to my questions. Each exercise requires that
 * you ask the user to enter one or more values. Your code must meet the
 * requirements set forth in this section (as well as the Deliverables section).
 *
 * Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask
 * questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.
